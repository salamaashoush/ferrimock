//! Single-owner VM event loop.
//!
//! rquickjs's scheduler wake queue holds a SINGLE `AtomicWaker` slot,
//! re-registered by whichever future last polled the scheduler. Any
//! short-lived `async_with!` that awaits inside its closure polls the
//! scheduler, steals that slot, and dies with it — after which every
//! external completion of a scheduler task (a `delay()` timer resolving,
//! an mpsc send into a `ctx.spawn` pump) wakes a dead task and the VM
//! never resumes. `AsyncRuntime::drive()` is no fix: it contends for the
//! same single slot, is only woken by new spawns (never by wakes of
//! existing tasks), and crashes under multi-thread load (SIGSEGV in its
//! lock-release path).
//!
//! The fix is the architecture every production QuickJS embedding
//! converges on (LLRT, txiki.js, quickjs-libc, Deno's isolate loop):
//! exactly ONE never-completing future owns the VM and its scheduler;
//! everything else sends messages. [`spawn_vm_loop`] starts that future
//! (a single persistent `async_with` per engine); [`VmHandle::with`]
//! submits a closure as a job which the loop `ctx.spawn`s onto the
//! scheduler, so jobs run concurrently with each other and with the
//! loop's own `recv` — a handler parked on a host await never blocks
//! another request's dispatch job arriving behind it. Because the loop
//! future never completes, every wake — scheduler queue slot, spawner
//! `listen`, channel recv — always targets a live task.
